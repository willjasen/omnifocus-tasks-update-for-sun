-- This updates the task time but changes it to today, need to leave it the same date (or filter)

-- Step 1: Get the sunset time using a shell command or external tool
set json to do shell script "curl -s 'https://api.sunrise-sunset.org/json?lat=36.320960&lng=--82.341760&formatted=1'"
set sunsetTime to do shell script "echo " & quoted form of json & " | /usr/local/bin/python -c 'import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)[\"results\"][\"sunset\"][:19].replace(\"T\", \" \"))'"

-- Step 2: Convert 12-hour time to 24-hour time
set sunsetTimeParsed to do shell script "date -j -f '%I:%M:%S %p' '" & sunsetTime & "' +'%H:%M:%S'"

-- Step 3: Create a date object for today with the sunset time
set sunsetDueTime to current date
set hours of sunsetDueTime to word 1 of sunsetTimeParsed
set minutes of sunsetDueTime to word 2 of sunsetTimeParsed
set seconds of sunsetDueTime to word 3 of sunsetTimeParsed

set theStartDate to current date
set hours of theStartDate to 0
set minutes of theStartDate to 0
set seconds of theStartDate to 0

set theEndDate to current date
set hours of theEndDate to 23
set minutes of theEndDate to 59
set seconds of theEndDate to 59

-- Step 2: Set the due date for the selected task in OmniFocus
tell application "OmniFocus"
    tell front document

        -- Get today and future tasks with the sunset tag
        set task_elements to flattened tasks whose Â¬
            (completed is false) and (due date is greater than or equal to theStartDate) and (due date is less than or equal to theEndDate) and (name of primary tag contains "ðŸŒ… Sunset")

        repeat with item_ref in task_elements

            set the_task to contents of item_ref

            -- Create a date object for the sunset time
            set task_due_time to sunsetDueTime

            -- Set the due date to the calculated sunset time
            set due date of the_task to task_due_time

        end repeat

    end tell
end tell
